In this code, the block returns a boolean value that represents whether or not the num parameter passed to the block is odd. In general, the return value of a block passed to Array#any? can be any value, which is determined by the last expression in the block. However, the block's return value is used to determine if any element in the calling array causes the block to evaluate to true for some element. In this case, the invocation of any? on [1, 2, 3] will return the value true, because num.odd? will evaluate to true for the elements 1 and 3. This expression will also output 1 to the console due to the puts statement in the block, but won't print anything else because 1.odd? will evaluate to true, thus terminating execution of the block for subsequent elements (since Array#any? only requires that the block return a truthy value at least one to return true, and thus doesn't need to evaluate anything else once it is determined that Array#any? will return true for some particular invocation)
