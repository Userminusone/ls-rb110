This statement returns 11. The Array#pop method removes the last element of the array and returns it, so in this case, the invocation of pop on ['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'] returns 'caterpillar', meaning this statement is equivalent to 'caterpillar'.size. The String#size method returns the number of characters in the string that it is invoked on, meaning this statement returns 11, since 'caterpillar' has 11 characters.
