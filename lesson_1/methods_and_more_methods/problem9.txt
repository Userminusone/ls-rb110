This invocation of map returns [nil, 'bear']. The Hash class has no instance of the map method, so it uses the map method defined in the Enumerable Module, which always returns an array. Enumerable#map returns a new array consisting of the elements returned by each invocation of the block passed to the invocation of map. In this case, the block returns nil for the first key value pair, and 'bear' for the second key value pair, meaning the overall expression returns [nil, 'bear'].
