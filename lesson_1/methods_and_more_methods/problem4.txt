This code will return the hash {'a' => 'ant', 'b' => 'bear', 'c' => 'cat'}. When we invoke each_with_object in this code example, we pass in an empty hash which subsequently gets passed to the block we pass in. In the block, we assign the value of the key "value[0]" to the value "value", meaning that, for every string in the array, this code adds a key value pair to the hash consisting of the first letter of the string and the string itself. Additionally, each_with_object returns the object we pass in to it, which results in the hash {'a' => 'ant', 'b' => 'bear', 'c' => 'cat'} being returned.
