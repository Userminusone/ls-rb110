This code returns the array [1, 2, 3]. The reject method returns an array containing all the elements for which invoking the block on some element returns a falsy value, meaning it returns false or nil. In this case, the last statement in the do end block is the puts num statement, and since the puts method always returns nil, all the elements will be returned from this invocation of reject.
