This code segment returns [1, nil, nil]. Within the block passed to the invocation of map, the expression "num > 1" only evaluates to false for the first element, 1, meaning that the expression "num" is executed, which results in the value 1 being returned from the block. For the next two elements, the expression in the if statement evaluates to true, which means "puts num" is executed instead, and thus, nil is returned from the block since puts always returns nil.
