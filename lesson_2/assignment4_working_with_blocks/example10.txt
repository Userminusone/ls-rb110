This program returns the multidimensional array [[[2, 3], [4, 5]], [6, 7]], but this return value isn't used.
On line 1 of this program, map is invoked on the multidimensional array [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [5, 6]], and each subarray is passed to the subsequent do..end block where it is used as the value that the block parameter arr is initialized to.
On line 2 of this program, map is invoked on the block parameter arr, and each element of arr is passed to the subsequent inner do..end block and is used as the value that the inner block parameter el is initialized to.
On line 3 of this program, the non destructive method to_s is invoked on the inner block parameter el, and then the non destructive method to_i is invoked on the return value of this invocation, and then the return value of this invocation is used as the first argument in the invocation of ==, while the inner block parameter el is used as the second argument to this invocation.
The return value of the invocation of == is used to determine which branch of the if statement will be executed.
On line 4 of this program, the + operator is invoked with the inner block parameter el and the literal 1, and since this is the last expression in the if branch of the if statement, the return value of el + 1 is returned from the if statement. On line 6 of this program, the map method is invoked on the inner block parameter el and each element of el is passed to the subsequent inner-inner do..end block which is used as the value that the inner-inner block parameter n is initialized to. On line 7 of this program, the + operator is invoked with the inner-inner block parameter n and the literal 1, and since this is the last expression in the inner-inner do..end block, the return value of n + 1 is used as the return value of the inner-inner do..end block, which is used to determine what the elements of the array returned from the invocation of map on the inner block parameter el will be. Since the invocation of map on the inner block parameter el is the last expression in the else branch of the if statement within the inner do..end block, its return value is used as the return value of the entire if statement.
Since the if statement is the last expression in the inner do..end block, its return value is used as the return value of the inner do..end block, which is used to determine what the elements of the array returned by the invocation of map on the outer block parameter arr will be.
Since the invocation of map on arr is the last expression in the outer do..end block, its value will be used as the return value of the outer do..end block, which is used to determine what the elements of the array returned by the invocation of map on the outer array will be.
