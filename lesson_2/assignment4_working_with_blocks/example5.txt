This code example will return the multidimensional array [[2, 4], [6, 8]], although it won't be used.
On line one of this program, the non destructive method map is invoked on the multidimensional array [[1, 2], [3, 4]], and each subarray within the outer array is passed to the subsequent do..end block and is used as the value that the block parameter arr is initialized to.
On line 2, the non destructive method map is invoked on the outer block parameter arr, and each element of arr is passed to the inner do..end block and is used as the value that the inner block parameter num is initialized to.
On line 3, the expression num * 2 is calculated, and since this expression is the last expression in the inner do..end block, the return value of this expression is used as the return value for the inner do..end block, which is then used to determine what each element of the transformed array returned by the map method will be.
Since the invocation of map on arr is the last expression within the outer do..end block, the return value of arr.map is used as the return value of the outer do..end block, which is then used to determine what each element of the transformed array returned by the map method will be.
