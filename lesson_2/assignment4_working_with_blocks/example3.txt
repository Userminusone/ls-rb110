On line 1, the map method is invoked on the multidimensional array [[1, 2], [3, 4]], and each subarray is passed to the do..end block, which is what the block parameter arr is initialized to.
On line 2, first is invoked on arr, and the first element of arr is retrieved and passed to the invocation of puts, which prints the resulting value to the screen and returns nil.
Because of this,
1
3
is printed to the console.
On line 3, first is again invoked on arr and the first element of arr is returned, and since this is the last line in the block, this value is returned from the block.
Since we are invoking the map method, the return value of the block is used to replace each element of the array with the return value of the block invocation with the value of said element passed to the block.
Because of this, the return value of the map invocation is the array [1, 3].
